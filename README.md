🌿 Overview

Harusi ya Belton was created to display live wedding contribution data in a clear, elegant, and transparent format.
It connects directly to a published Google Sheet and presents the data in real-time — with no backend code, no framework, and no complexity.

Principles of the build:

Simplicity — one HTML file, no external scripts or frameworks.

Transparency — all data visible to contributors.

Speed — lightweight, static, and instantly loads.

Accessibility — responsive across all devices.
